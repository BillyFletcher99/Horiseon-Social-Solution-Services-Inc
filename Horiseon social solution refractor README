This is my submisson for my first HW assignment! 
Not entirely sure what to put here, it took me a while to really get a grasp on what i was changing and why,
But eventually it started to make a little more sense. 

The main goal of this HW was to refactor the code given to us for the horiseon website; The website was already up and running,
it was in our duty to streamline it more and clean it up; NOT change the code. 

Amongest some of the changes i made are the following:
-Changed title to an accurate name
-Added comments for a more user friendly guide
-Named conetent appropriately throughout the html and matched it on the CSS script to make it more coherent and streamlined
-added "Alts" to the pictures for a reference of what it is at glance
-Tried to make a more coherent semantic sequence throughout the HTML script.
There are more i believe, but this is what i did today (as i've been working on this awhile lol)

I do believe this is what the readme is for after completing the hw, but i'm not 100%.
